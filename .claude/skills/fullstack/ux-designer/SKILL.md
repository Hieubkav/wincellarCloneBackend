description: Expert UI/UX design guidance for building unique, accessible, and user-centered interfaces. Use when designing interfaces, making visual design decisions, choosing colors/typography, implementing responsive layouts, or when user mentions design, UI, UX, styling, or visual appearance. Always ask before making design decisions.

## Core Philosophy

**CRITICAL: Design Decision Protocol**
- **ALWAYS ASK** before making any design decisions (colors, fonts, sizes, layouts)
- Never implement design changes until explicitly instructed
- The guidelines below are practical guidance for when design decisions are approved
- Present alternatives and trade-offs, not single "correct" solutions

## Foundational Design Principles

### Stand Out From Generic Patterns

**Avoid Generic Training Dataset Patterns:**
- Don't default to "Claude style" designs (excessive bauhaus, liquid glass, apple-like)
- Don't use generic SaaS aesthetics that look machine-generated
- Don't rely only on solid colors - suggest photography, patterns, textures
- Think beyond typical patterns - you can step off the written path

**Draw Inspiration From:**
- Modern landing pages (Perplexity, Comet Browser, Dia Browser)
- Framer templates and their innovative approaches
- Leading brand design studios
- Historical design movements (Bauhaus, Otl Aicher, Braun) - but as inspiration, not imitation
- Beautiful background animations (CSS, SVG) - slow, looping, subtle

**Visual Interest Strategies:**
- Unique color pairs that aren't typical
- Animation effects that feel fresh
- Background patterns that add depth without distraction
- Typography combinations that create contrast
- Visual assets that tell a story

### Core Design Philosophy

1. **Simplicity Through Reduction**
   - Identify the essential purpose and eliminate distractions
   - Begin with complexity, then deliberately remove until reaching the simplest effective solution
   - Every element must justify its existence

2. **Material Honesty**
   - Digital materials have unique properties - embrace them
   - Buttons should feel pressable, cards should feel substantial
   - Animations should reflect real-world physics while embracing digital possibilities
   - **Prefer flat minimal design with no depth (no shadows, gradients, glass effects)**

3. **Obsessive Detail**
   - Consider every pixel, every interaction, every transition
   - Excellence emerges from hundreds of thoughtful decisions
   - Collectively project a feeling of quality

4. **Coherent Design Language**
   - Every element should visually communicate its function
   - Elements should feel like part of a unified system
   - Nothing should feel arbitrary

5. **Invisibility of Technology**
   - The best technology disappears
   - Users should focus on content and goals, not on understanding the interface

## Accessibility Standards

**Core Requirements:**
- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines
- Ensure keyboard navigability for all interactive elements
- Minimum touch target size: 44×44px
- Use semantic HTML for screen reader compatibility
- Provide alternative text for images and non-text content

**Implementation Details:**
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Event functions: prefix with "handle" (handleClick, handleKeyDown)
- Add accessibility attributes:
  - `tabindex="0"` for custom interactive elements
  - `aria-label` for buttons without text
  - `role` attributes when semantic HTML isn't sufficient
- Ensure logical tab order
- Provide visible focus states

## Design Process & Testing

### Design Workflow

1. **Understand Context:**
   - What problem are we solving?
   - Who are the users and when will they use this?
   - What are the success criteria?

2. **Explore Options:**
   - Present 2-3 alternative approaches
   - Explain trade-offs of each option
   - Ask which direction resonates

3. **Implement Iteratively:**
   - Start with structure and hierarchy
   - Add visual polish progressively
   - Test at each stage

4. **Validate:**
   - Use playwright MCP to test visual changes
   - Check across different screen sizes
   - Verify accessibility

### Testing Checklist

**Visual Testing:**
- Use playwright MCP when available for automated testing
- Check responsive behavior at common breakpoints
- Verify touch targets on mobile
- Test with different content lengths (short, long, edge cases)

**Accessibility Testing:**
- Test keyboard navigation
- Verify screen reader compatibility
- Check color contrast ratios
- Ensure focus states are visible

**Cross-Device Testing:**
- Test on actual devices, not just emulators
- Check different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Verify touch interactions on mobile
- Test landscape and portrait orientations

## Common Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Don't:**
- Use generic SaaS blue (#3B82F6) without considering alternatives
- Default to shadows and gradients for depth
- Copy Apple's design language
- Use glass morphism effects
- Make design decisions without asking
- Implement typography without considering the font version
- Use animations that delay user actions
- Create cluttered interfaces with competing elements

✅ **Do:**
- Ask before making design decisions
- Suggest unique, contextually appropriate color pairs
- Use flat, minimal design
- Consider unconventional typography choices
- Provide immediate feedback for interactions
- Create generous white space
- Test with real devices
- Validate accessibility
