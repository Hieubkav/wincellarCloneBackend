## Visual Design Standards

### Color & Contrast

**Intentional Color Usage:**
- Every color must have a specific purpose
- Avoid decorative colors that don't communicate function or hierarchy
- Use color to convey meaning: success, warning, information, action
- Maintain consistency in color relationships throughout

**Sophisticated Palettes:**
- Prefer subtle, slightly desaturated colors over bold primary colors
- Consider colors that feel "photographed" rather than "rendered"
- Use neutral pastel palettes with accent colors for focus
- Use warm greys as base tones
- Limit accent colors to guide attention to the most important actions

**Accessibility:**
- Ensure sufficient contrast for color-blind users
- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA standards (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text)
- Don't rely on color alone to convey information

**Current Style Preferences:**
- Prefer flat minimal design
- Don't use shadows, gradients, or glass effects
- Don't mimic Apple/iOS aesthetics
- Use unique color pairs that aren't typical

### Typography Excellence

**Font Selection Philosophy:**
- Typography is a core design element, not an afterthought
- **Don't worship legibility** - pick fonts that trigger emotion for headlines
- Every typeface choice should serve the app's purpose and personality
- Limit to 2-3 typefaces maximum per application

**Font Version Usage:**
- **Display version:** For big headlines only
- **Text version:** For long bodies of text
- **Caption/Micro versions:** For small short texts (1-2 lines)

**Recommended Fonts:**
- Use Google Fonts for web typography
- Consider: DM Sans, Mozilla Text, Lato, Arimo, system defaults
- Clean, readable sans-serif and serif combinations
- Trending fonts on Google Fonts for fresh, modern feel

**Typographic Hierarchy:**
- Create clear visual distinction between information levels
- Headlines, subheadings, body text, captions should each have distinct appearance
- Use mathematical relationships between text sizes (golden ratio or major third)

**Spacing & Kerning:**
- Line height: typically 1.5x font size for body text
- Allow generous spacing around text elements
- **Kerning Guidelines:**
  - Adjust based on text size
  - Bigger text = smaller kerning
  - Large font: -4 kerning
  - Average text: 0 kerning (optimal for most typefaces)
  - Very small font: +4 kerning

**Typography Contrast:**
- Combine typefaces to grab attention and drive interest
- Create contrast through weight, size, and style variations

### Layout & Spatial Design

**Compositional Balance:**
- Every screen should feel balanced
- Pay attention to visual weight and negative space
- Use generous negative space to focus attention
- Add sufficient margins and paddings for professional, spacious look

**Grid Discipline:**
- Maintain consistent underlying grid system
- Create sense of order while allowing meaningful exceptions
- Use grid/flex wrappers with `gap` for spacing
- Prioritize wrappers over direct margins/padding on children

**Spatial Relationships:**
- Group related elements through proximity, alignment, and shared attributes
- Use size, color, and spacing to highlight important elements
- Guide user focus through visual hierarchy

**Attention Guidance:**
- Design interfaces that guide user attention effectively
- Avoid cluttered interfaces where elements compete
- Create clear paths through the content
