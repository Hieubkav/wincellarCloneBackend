# Performance Optimization Strategies

## Optimization Roadmap

### Quick Wins (1-2 days)
- Enable gzip compression
- Minify CSS/JavaScript
- Compress images (lossless)
- Remove unused CSS
- Defer non-critical JavaScript
- Preload critical fonts

### Medium Effort (1-2 weeks)
- Implement lazy loading
- Code splitting (split routes)
- Service worker for caching
- Image optimization (WebP, srcset)
- Critical CSS extraction
- HTTP/2 server push

### Long-term (1-3 months)
- Migrate to faster framework
- Database query optimization
- Content delivery optimization
- Architecture refactor
- CDN implementation
- Build process optimization

## Optimization Checklist

### Network
- [ ] Gzip compression enabled
- [ ] Brotli compression enabled
- [ ] HTTP/2 enabled
- [ ] CDN configured
- [ ] Browser caching configured
- [ ] Asset fingerprinting

### JavaScript
- [ ] Code split by route
- [ ] Unused code removed
- [ ] Minified and mangled
- [ ] Source maps generated
- [ ] Deferred non-critical

### CSS
- [ ] Critical CSS extracted
- [ ] Unused CSS removed
- [ ] Minified
- [ ] Preloaded fonts
- [ ] WOFF2 format used

### Images
- [ ] Optimized and compressed
- [ ] WebP with fallback
- [ ] Responsive srcset
- [ ] Lazy loading
- [ ] SVG where possible

## Implementation Tips

- Start with quick wins for immediate impact
- Measure impact of each optimization
- Don't over-optimize prematurely
- Focus on user-facing improvements first
- Document all changes for team
