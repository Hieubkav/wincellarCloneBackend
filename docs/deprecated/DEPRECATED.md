## Why These Are Deprecated

1. Many fixes have been integrated into main docs
2. Some issues were already resolved in later phases
3. Better documentation exists in `/docs/setup/` and `/docs/features-detailed/`

---

## How to Handle

- ✅ Refer to current docs in `/docs/setup/`, `/docs/architecture/`, `/docs/phases/`
- ❌ Don't use documentation from this folder
- 🗑️ Safe to delete after archiving if needed
- 📝 If you need an old pattern, check `/docs/` first
